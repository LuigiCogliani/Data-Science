# Apache Spark with *Pyspark*

## *PartBSpark.py*: we want to evaluate the top 10 smart contracts by total Ether received. We will get the total Ether received from each address and check which address is also present in the "contracts" dataset, hence which address is actually a contract. The we will sort and get the top 10 results.
## *C1*: open csv, rename, group and sum columns. Extract month and year from datetime with average and save as csv, in order to plot it as a histogram
## *C2*: merge dataframes, sort and show Toop10 values
