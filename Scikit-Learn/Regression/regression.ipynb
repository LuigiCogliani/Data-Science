    "#### The first question we need to ask ourselves is: what is the purpose of building this model (1.1)? Usually the model itself is not the end goal, but it will be used for business purposes. Knowing this an advance will save us the embarassement (and company time) of building a model that does not provide the insights the team was expecting / needing (1.2). This information will help us decide on some specifics of the model / project: for instance, based on the company necessity, this could be an online model that continuosly recieves data an has to be monitored and re-trained on an hourly basis or an offline model, that will be monitored and trained again when the performance drops under a set threshold (1.4). In this case, since we are dealing with labeled data, we have a *supervised learning* task. It is a *regression* problem,since we are trying to make a prediction, and since we are dealing with multiple features, it is a *multivariate regression*. Now that we framed the problem we can choose a performance metric (1.5). Typical metrics for regression problems are RMSE (root mean squared error) and MAE (mean average error). RMSE indicates the standard deviation from the mean. If the data follows a normal distribution, an RMSE of 50k dollars means about 68% of the model predictions fall within 50k dollars of the actual value and 95% within $100k of the actual value. This metric is not robust against outliers: in the presence of many outliers it is preferrable to use MAE."
